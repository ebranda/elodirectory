CELL OAI-PMH
============

This Drupal 7 module extends the [Views OAI-PMH](https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/views_oai_pmh)
module for the needs of the [Consortium on Electronic Literature
(CELL)](http://eliterature.org/cell/)'s OAI-PMH metadata sharing project.

This module's only task, at least for now, is to add CELL-specific subelements
to the `<extension>` element of the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS)
metadata format.
